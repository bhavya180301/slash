### Improvised Wishlist page

### Check Price Drop (using Selenium webdriver for consistent results)
We have introduced a new feature (this includes frontend and backend changes) that allows users to track price changes for wishlisted products. This functionality enables users to monitor fluctuations in the prices of their desired items by comparing the current price with the initial price recorded when the product was added to the wishlist.

### Set and stop price alert (Email notifications using Flask Mail):
We have implemented a feature that enables users to receive email notifications for price drops on wishlisted items. This enhances their shopping experience by providing timely updates on potential savings.
